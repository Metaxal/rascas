Computer Algebra System for Racket.

This is a port of [dharmatech/mpl](https://github.com/dharmatech/mpl) from r6rs to Racket. See there for more information.

It does not need any other library apart from the standard Racket ones. (In particular, the dependency on dharmatech/surfage has been replaced with Racket's srfi libraries, and the dependency on dharmatech/dharmalab have been replaced with new code.)

# rascas
Computer Algebra System for Racket.

This is a port of [dharmatech/mpl](https://github.com/dharmatech/mpl) from r6rs to Racket. 

See the file [`tests.rkt`](https://github.com/Metaxal/rascas/blob/master/tests.rkt) for examples.

Also check out another CAS for Racket, [soegaard/racket-cas](https://github.com/soegaard/racket-cas).
